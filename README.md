# MLIPy

The package helps to load the predictor method of the MLIP code (**M**achine **L**earning **I**nteratomic **P**otential, see references) into a python workflow. This allow users to test ideas, reuse the python code here implemented, and design pure Python approaches to calculate energies, forces, and stress in a crystal configuration. Even though the present package can be used as a calculator for [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) objects, still a MLIP potential would be required.
